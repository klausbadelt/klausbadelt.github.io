    <h2>Biography <small>Summer 2014</small></h2>

    <p>One of the most acclaimed and prolific film composers of his generation, Klaus Badelt is best known for writing the large-scale score to "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," which defined the franchise and brought him worldwide recognition.</p>
    <p>Klaus has composed music for more than 80 films, including projects for top-names like Kathryn Bigelow, Ridley Scott, Terrence Malick, Wolfgang Petersen, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Harvey Weinstein.</p>
    <p>Over the years Klaus has also successfully defined his profile, independent of glamour and the “biz.” "Some of my favorite projects are the more independent films, maybe even the lesser known ones," he says. Referring to the fact that his heart beats in telling a beautiful story, caring for the characters on the screen, and stealing you away for 90 minutes. "If you come out of the theater moved and inspired, I couldn't have done better.”</p>
    <p>In addition to the major studios, Klaus also makes time to work with outstanding independent filmmakers and lend his talent to first-class “Indie” projects, stage-plays, operas, theme park rides, and special events, including scoring four films with Werner Herzog (“Queen of the Desert,” “Happy People: A Year in the Taiga”, “Rescue Dawn,” and “Invincible”), and spending five months in China working with Chen Kaige ("Farewell My Concubine"), a leading figure of the fifth generation of Chinese cinema. Much to his delight, Klaus’ music has also been performed by some of the world’s most prestigious orchestras, and in concerts throughout the world.</p>
    <p>Klaus was born in Frankfurt, Germany and moved to the United States in 1998. In addition to his home and main studios in Santa Monica, Klaus maintains production studios in Paris. In 2005 Klaus moved his studio temporarily to Beijing, traveled the provinces of China and studied their ancient songs, instruments, and dances while composing the score for “The Promise.” From there, it was on to London where he set up shop and immersed himself in a major UK production, to work with the great John Madden ("Shakespeare in Love").</p>
    <p>In 2008, the Beijing Olympic committee invited him as the only western composer to participate in the closing event ceremonies. Following that, the ancient capital city of Xi'an commissioned Klaus to write the "Terracotta Warriors" opera, which premiered at one of China’s most famous tourist attractions and the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site’s monumental new development. These events further solidified Klaus’ love of music from all parts of the world, which he embraces and draws from in virtually every one of his scores.</p>
    <p>Further west, Klaus was entrusted to write the score for the French national icon "Little Nicolas," based on the hugely successful series of children’s books written by Rene Goscinny. Continuing his work in France, Klaus also composed the score for the feature “Asterix and Obelix: God Save Britannia,” the latest big screen installment of the treasured franchise, based on the comic book series. More recently, Klaus composed the score for Dany Boon’s “Supercondriaque,” which hit the screens in March 2014 and enjoyed the largest opening of any French Film in the past two years.</p>
    <p>“To capture the essence of the moment is my greatest goal, whether it is for an international tent-pole (“Pirates of the Caribbean,” “Gladiator,” “Mission Impossible,”’ “Scorpion King,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” etc.), or a more heart-warming, tender story. Klaus is in love with experimenting, breaking out of the ordinary, and never, ever repeating himself.</p>
    <p>With the desire to work with the most interesting of people on a wide-range of projects, Klaus’ career is a diverse, inspired, dream come true.</p>
